Yohay's Codes:

1) PolygonsCode
Code for define presence in pre-defined polygons

This code can calculate for you if the location of your animal is in a specific geographic polygon.
A few requirements:

The locations coordinates needs to be in decimal degrees and in WGS84 Mercator.
In your locations containing data base, the coordinates should be in columns named: "Latitude" & "Longitude" (Case sensitive).
The polygons files should be in KML format, and in one directory (I made them thru Google Earth).

2) Day/Night Progress
Code for creating a progress scale from 0 to 100 for each night or day.

Good Luck
