# PolygonsCode
Code for define presence in pre-defined polygons

This code can calculate for you if the location of your animal is in a specific geographic polygon.
A few requirements:

The locations coordinates needs to be in decimal degrees and in WGS84 Mercator.
In your locations containing data base, the coordinates should be in columns named: "Latitude" & "Longitude" (Case sensitive).
The polygons files should be in KML format, and in one directory (I made them thru Google Earth).
Good Luck
